      <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Derek Stiles and I currently reside in Washington D.C. 
      I graduated from Washington College in 2017 and currently work as a management consultant at Eagle Hill Consulting.
      For more information on my professional background, please visit my LinkedIn.
      </p>
      <p>Some of my favorite hobbies outside of work are exploring D.C.'s food scene and working out. 
      I played since soccer from the age of four through college, and I'm currently training for my first marathon.
      </p>
      <p>Over the past year, I began learning how to code. After focusing on data science for the a few months, I realized that creating amazing products was what I wanted to do. 
      This led me to enroll Lambda School's Web Development track to become a software engineer.
